<p>Madeline Stark is a software development student at the Flatiron school. Madeline first became interested in programming while she was teaching at Girls Inc., an after school and summer program focused on empowering girls. Girls Inc.'s push to expose girls to the possibilities of STEM fields inspired Madeline to further explore Technology herself. She hopes to leave Flatiron with an education that will empower her to be a better teacher and to build a career in software design.</p>
