&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my second portfolio project through the Flatiron School, I designed a diary application called Dear Diary, using Sinatra and Active Record. This module of the program focused on SQL, Active Record, HTML, CSS, and Sinatra. It was exciting learning new technologies to help create real functioning applications. With SQL and Active Record I was able to store and analyze user data. HTML and CSS allowed me to style my program and display it in a browser. And Sinatra gave me a system for creating urls and users. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve enjoyed working with Sinatra because I’m easily able to view my work in a browser using Shotgun. It’s a great way to test your code and very rewarding to be able to immediately see your work come to life.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my portfolio project I decided to create a diary application because I thought it would be a great exercise in protecting views. My app allows users to create, edit, read, and delete diary entries. Users can not view, edit, or delete other user’s diary entries. Most functions of the application like creating a new entry are only available to users when they are logged in. The layout view adds a footer to each page that shows a different navigation menu depending on whether or not that user is logged in. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was also one of my first times using a Helper class to store methods. I created methods to check if the params being passed in are valid, whether or not the user is logged in, and who the current user is. I found storing these methods in a helper class to be a great way of avoiding the repetition of code. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to add more to this project I’d like to flesh out the html and css. I’d also consider giving users more options like whether or not to make an entry private or the option to change the date. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than those possible changes I’m very proud of what I’ve created and everything I’ve learned so far in the program.
