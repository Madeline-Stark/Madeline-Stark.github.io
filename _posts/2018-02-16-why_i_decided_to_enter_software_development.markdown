&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested in programming because of its capacity for invention. I love that when approaching an idea with programming skills and creativity, one can make something amazing with virtually no supplies needed. To me that's a creative process akin to writing or playing music. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was first introduced to programming while I was teaching at Girls Inc. Girls Inc. is an afterschool and summer program for girls. Their mission statement is "inspiring girls to be strong, smart, and bold". Part of fulfilling that mission includes encouraging our students' involvement in STEM. I started learning to code along with the girls on Code.org's Hour of Code with Blockly. I loved that just by rearranging these blocks I could control the movements of the Minecraft characters. To me, Hour of Code established that coding means power. Instead of being a passive consumer of the digital world, coding gives you the chance to be a creator. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've loved the challenge of solving interesting problems through code and the satisfaction that comes with the solution. My favorite experiences so far have been when I am really struggling to get my tests to pass. It can be disheartening when all of your tests fail and you have to retool the same few lines over and over again. But the struggle is always so worth it when you finally figure out what you need to change and you're rewarded with "0 failures" written in beautiful, bright green. Its on par with the satisfaction that comes with getting to the next level in a game after you've had to repeat it over and over again first.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm excited to make this process a part of my everyday life. A year from now I hope to be a full stack developer, working for a company making a positive impact on the world, and volunteer teaching programming. I'm excited to return to teaching with even more to share with my students. I can't wait to share the joys of problem solving and the power that comes with the ability to create.
